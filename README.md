# BAPHOMET

Extensible definition forms supporting packages-as-types convention for Common Lisp.

## History

The `BAPHOMET` library began life as a fork of [DEMACS][], went through a few
name changes, took inspiration from [DEFINER][] and [CL-DEF][], then got
hoodwinked into adopting the packages-as-types convention for the Blackfire and
Quicksilver projects.

### 03-27-2022

The present codebase was in the midst of yet another massive rewrite, so the
documentation has been excluded from the present code-dump due to its appalling
inapplicability.

Also, I don't think the current code-base compiles and loads, but I hope to get
it working for the next Quicklisp release.
